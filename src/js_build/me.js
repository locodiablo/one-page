      body: `
        To deliver real value, brand needs to be a cherished investment -
        not a resented expense. Applied without faith as a superficial after-thought,
        it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy of inadequate commitment, inadequate results.
        Some think they can't afford to apply brand properly,
        others know they can't afford not to.`

        I've been Editor of a construction industry analysis journal,
        directed creative media for an international &pound;32m turnover company,
        founded a new clothing brand from scratch,
        and freelanced for 9 years helping businesses get more from pixels and print. I have designed user journeys and built API dashboards, websites, and PDF documents with NPM and javascript.
        I value data-driven decisions, respect the purity of non-repetitive coding and enjoy orchestrating brand assets that deliver measurable value.`

        Anything to do with motorbikes, beaches (winter, summer, rain or shine).
        Badminton, squash, and kickboxing: W-2 L-1 D-0 (my remaining knee cartilage demands these should be pursued with reduced ferocity) PlayStation games rob me of a few hours: I'm currently mesmerised by Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, and truly astonished by the attention to detail, especially the lighting effects.
        Trying to imagine how I'd even begin programming behavioural light algorithms makes my eyes swap sockets.
        I've also developed a fascination with e-vehicles and genetics.`
